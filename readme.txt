What factors most affect happiness?

Gapminder took a global poll where participants were asked where, on a scale of 1 being the worst possible life and 10 being the best possible life, where they felt they personally landed at the time of asking. These responses were ranked by year and by national average response score.

The responses intrigued me, as some nations ranked higher than others, and wanted to see what correlations happiness had against other metrics. I will analyze the data against the following three other Gapminder data sets:

Income - Mean household income
Life expectancy - the average number of years a newborn child would live
Gini - inequality coefficient (higher meaning more inequality)
